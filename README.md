## Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ My current projects include:
  - Preprocessing and visualising player data from FIFA22 using Python, moving to regression analysis of player performance by age.
  - A Tableau dashboard to better demonstrate progress made in weightlifting, with data downloaded from an exercise app and processed through Python to create a robust exercise database.
  - Smaller side-projects such as a poker simulator, allowing me to practice programming concepts.
    
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying The Data Science Course from Careers365, focusing on regression models and deep learning through Python,
      as well as the Automate the Boring Stuff course by Al Sweigart.
  
- ðŸ’¬ I'm aiming to gain employment in a data capacity and work towards a masters degree in the coming years.
